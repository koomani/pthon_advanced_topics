# Tuple vs. List: (over-allocating)

# the list is mutable. It means that you can add more elements to it (tuple TypeError)
# the storage efficiency of a tuple is greater than a list (tuple is faster than list) WHY?
	# because list is mutable. It means that you can add more elements to it, so Python needs to allocate more memory than needed to the list. This is called over-allocating. 
	# the over-allocation improves performance when a list is expanded.
	# Mmanwhile, a tuple is immutable therefore its element count is fixed. So Python just needs to allocate enough memory to store the initial elements.

fruits = ('apple', 'orange', 'banana')                          
# size of the tuple is 64 bytes.
print(f'The size of the tuple is {getsizeof(fruits)} bytes.')        # The size of the list is 72 bytes. ()
	
# copying a tuple is faster than a list
	# because copying a list, python creates a new list
	# when copying a tuple, Python just reuses an existing tuple. It doesnâ€™t create a new tuple because tuples are immutable. Therefore, copying a tuple always slightly faster than a list
		# ** Copying tuple = adding new refernce to same object
